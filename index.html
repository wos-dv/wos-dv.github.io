<h3 id="tiling-window-managers-suck-the-idiocy-of-window-tiling">Tiling window managers suck &amp; the idiocy of window tiling</h3>
<p>What are tiling window managers you ask? Better yet, what is a window manager?</p>
<p>Window managers (WMs) orchestrate the layout of windows you see on screen. They pretty much decide where to draw the application on your screen, how big the window is, some even add decorations to the window such as a close button etc. (windows users probably can’t image how one would close windows without a close button in the corner).</p>
<p>Now, a tiling window manager (TWM) usually brings two things to the table but only one of them is inherent to TWM. The first thing easy setting of shortcuts do control applications and windows. The second thing is ‘window tiling’. Tiling of windows or ‘window tiling’ means that application windows are laid out in such a manner, that they fill the screen without overlapping. Usually this involves a policy to divide the screen space between the currently rendered windows. This policy could be to divide the screen evenly between the windows or to have one master window that is larger than the rest, while the rest chill out on a pile with only the top one visible etc.. There are many such policies and it doesn’t really matter since they all suck. And here is the reason why.</p>
<p>T<span class="smallcaps">WM</span>s suck because they contradict many of their alleged strengths.</p>
<p>First of these strengths is ‘conserving screen space’. Now if someone would try to convince me, that filling the screen with inactive windows ‘conserves screen space’, then I would marvel at that Orwell level of double-think. Try to do it reader and come to your senses! It’s a great lie! The whole notion is just illogical, I don’t even think that the first tiling managers were invented for this purpose of ‘conserving screen space’. If they were, then I amazed how their inventor could come up with the such an anti-solution to the problem without actually noticing that it. ‘Oh, you retard, you can just maximize the window you are currently working on, so that the others don't bother you. You are clearly a noob that knows nothing.’ if such an argument were to occur in someones head, I hope, that the explosion caused by the void occupying the inner regions of their skull fails to hurt anybody when the bone finally gives in to the negative pressure. Because that is the whole point! You are not tilling when maximized, you are switching it off, because it’s in the way. Just switch it off for good. And be done with it. Real ‘conservation of screen space’ happens only when the windows don’t tile but instead they overlap.</p>
<p>Just to touch upon workspaces. Those are utter garbage too and you really shouldn’t be using them. If you do a thing, do a thing and don’t leave ten unrelated things open on a different workspace, that just makes doing the thing harder. You only need workspaces because of tiling idiocy. If you let windows overlap, workspaces are superfluous.</p>
<p>At this point I need to explain how people actually use a TWM. The core philosophy is keyboard oriented so that you don’t have to use your mouse to interact with the window or to move the selection of windows (focus) between different windows. But tiling windows manages to negate these otherwise big advantages. The reason why this is the case is very simple. Most of the time the layout that results from multiple windows being tiled is not a grid so it is impossible to tell where your next command will shift the focus without actually thinking about how your WM is organizing your windows. So it’s basically impossible without thinking which most of us don’t do, we just try and if it doesn’t work out we try again, wasting key-presses. Even dose that are able to do it fast are just wasting effort. Some might argue that one can bind keys to switch to specific windows. I just add to that, that such bindings work even better if you don’t tile your windows.</p>
<p>Some window managers are better than others, since they recognize the poison that is tiling itself. Take for example AwesomeWM(AWM). AWM makes it possible to switch the focus between windows reliably even when in floating mode (floating mode is the equivalent of the layout that MS Windows uses, which means no-tiling). This alone redeems AWM from the tragic anti-pattern of window tiling. Other TWM should emulate this and drop the T from TWM as it is the only workflow that is not crippling to the user. Really AWM is not a TWM as the name reflects it. It can do what a TWM can, but thankfully, it can also not-tile which is key. I don’t know what the future of WMs is going to be, but I’m convinced more than ever that it’s not going to be the tiling of windows.</p>
